How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was helped to detect the itroduced bug by not having to check through
    both files manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you are able to track your progress and changes made during the entire project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - comit would be just fine, at the right moment

    cons - commit might be too bit. when changes made are piled up

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    i dont know what to say

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log gives you a detailed list of comits

    git diff allows you to check for changes made between comits 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i am confident because i can always to back to the last working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to use it in working on my first project
	
	i am testing git on goormeIDE
